- What is this?
- This doesn’t sound like a rap song?
- It’s kinda beautiful, tho
- Oh snap, the beats about to drop.
- Come on, beat, drop.
- The beat dropped.
- This is not what I expected to hear when the beat dropped.
- “Let me innnnn, to your heart” Ok, i can work with this.
- This is like some primal, loving screaming. I love this.
- Donald Glover is on some other stuff, honestly.
- That falsetto, tho.
- I can’t help thinking he’s singing about Van.
- Or maybe Jhene Aiko, i dunno.
- More songs need proper screams.
- “Oh my god”
- I need to see this live. I want to feel this vibe.
- Oh, it’s slowing down now.
- Is that a tambourine….. Heat check.
- Ambient noises now, a cool down from the screaming.
- Can this song last forever, plz?
- What kind of instrument is that?
- I feel calm for some reason.
- I’m just gonna listen to this all day, now.
